## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
- `tesxt-classification.html`: Contains the code in html format. 
- `text-classification.ipynb`: Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step code.
- `readme`: README.md file
- `requirements.txt`: Libraries required to run the project

## Features
- Text classification into four complaint categories.
- Preprocessing of text data, including cleaning and tokenization.
- Use of machine learning models for classification.
- Evaluation of model performance using accuracy and confusion matrices.
- Prediction of new consumer complaints.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries mentioned in `requirements.txt`

## Installation Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/Consumer-Complaints-Text-Classification.git]
   cd Consumer-Complaints-Text-Classification

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

4. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## How to Run:

Navigate to the project directory.
To train and evaluate a model, run the Jupyter notebooks.
To make predictions on new consumer complaints, follow the instructions provided in the notebooks or scripts.

## How This Project is Made
This project is built using Python and various libraries, including Scikit-Learn for machine learning, Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib for data visualization. The dataset is preprocessed, and text classification models are trained and evaluated. Predictions on new complaints are also demonstrated.

For detailed step-by-step instructions and code, refer to the Jupyter notebooks in the directories.
